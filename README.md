# ConfigMaxxing library mod for Minecraft Forge 1.7.10
![logo](logo_small.png)

### What is this?
It is a library mod adding "graphical wrappers" for Forge config value selectors. For now there is a potion and mob picker available. The usage is pretty simple to figure out by looking inside the mod's code. Its also pretty easy to implement your own pickers, the examples are pretty self-explanatory. Pull requests with pickers are welcome.

### How to build?
`gradlew build` should do the trick.
